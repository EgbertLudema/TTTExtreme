# TTTExtreme
TicTacToe extreme build using JavaScript

I started this project when my teacher assigned the task to code something you've always wanted to code. And so I coded my own tictactoe extreme game since I used to play this with paper and pencils.

Disclaimer: This is still a work in progress. Some things aren't finished yet!

I'm planning on adding these features in the future:
- Friendlist
- Play online against a random player in queue
- Play against friends
- Play as guest as default(login or sign in button in the menu)
- Mobile friendly
- Eventually create a app for the game

<h1>Import guide:</h1>
- Import all files into your server or localhost
- Import the tttextreme. into your database

Enjoy!

# TTTExtreme
TicTacToe extreme build using JavaScript

I started this project when a teacher said: Start coding or programming something you always wanted to code/program and work on it each day for 10-30min. By doing this you'll get better at coding through time.

So I build my own TicTacToe Extreme as I always play this by drawing it on paper.

Disclaimer: This is still a work in progress. Some things aren't finished yet!

Import all files into your server or localhost
Import the tttextreme.sql

Enjoy!
